AI Trading Signals<br>
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based trading signals are starting to see more and more traction among retail and institutional traders. But what exactly are they and how can they be used?<br>
<br>
A trading signal interprets and analyses data to determine whether you should buy or sell a security. They can be a great way to improve your trades and help you make rational decisions. Trading signals also allow people to copy the trades of other successful traders.<br>
<br>
However, now, thanks to the introduction of AI, trading signals are becoming even more useful. By AI being able to analyse huge amounts of data, it can help provide the exact trading signals for individual assets that will have a high probability of success. The AI trading signals can now provide the explicit entry price, stop loss and take profit. These signals also follow risk management rules which make them suited to help traders optimise their risk/reward ratio.However, now, thanks to the introduction of AI, trading signals are becoming even more useful.

<br>
What do AI Trading Signals base their data on?<br>
AI trading signals typically inform a trader on buying or selling, an entry price, a stop loss price and target price. Most trading signals tend to be focused on forex, however they are other trading signals for markets such as stocks, commodities and indices.<br>
<br>
Each AI trading signal provider base their signals on different pieces of data, however these are some of the pieces of data which are usually used to create the signals:<br>
<br>
Price action<br>
This is where AI will read the market and implement trading decisions based on the recent and actual price movements.<br>
<br>
Currency valuation<br>
AI can analyse purchase price parity (PPP) metrics to find undervalued or overvalued currencies.<br>
<br>
News/Social Media analysis<br>
AI can analyse real-time data from news providers, social media and blogs and then create a  trading signal to the trader based on this information.<br>
<br>
Technical Analysis<br>
Through using historical data and analysing the charts of various instruments the artificial intelligence can provide technical indicators and signals to the trader.<br>
<br>
How can you use AI Trading Signals?<br>
There are various factors you should consider before using AI trading signal providers. Here are some of the leading factors worth considering:<br>
<br>
Cost of the signals<br>
Signals are usually subscription based, however the costs vary widely. Some providers are fairly low cost and others can be very expensive, therefore it is important to make sure you select a signal provider that fits within your budget.<br>
<br>
Timing of the signals<br>
Many signals require the trades to be executed immediately, therefore you need to stay on top when the signals are sent out and have access to your trading platform when the signals are sent out to you. Due to the signals needing to be executed quickly you need to make sure you use a signal provider that operates in or near your time zone.<br>
<br>
Mode of delivery<br>
Every signal provider has different ways of delivering the signals, many use platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, SMS and Email. You’ll need to make sure you have access to these platforms in order to ensure you receive the signals.<br>
<br>
Type of signals<br>
The signals you receive will depend on your account size and your availability. There’s also signals for day traders and swing traders, so you’ll need to choose which one you’d prefer.<br>
<br>
Reliability and reputation<br>
Finally, you’ll need to make sure you do your due diligence and ensure that the AI trading signal provider is reliable. In order to do this check the reviews of the provider and how good their win rate is.<br>
<br>
<br>
Why use AI Trading Signals?<br>
The biggest advantage of using AI trading signals is the time it saves. Having to manually analyse the market, identify directions and recognise trends is a very time consuming task and by using AI trading signals you’re saving precious time.<br>
You do not have to have expertise in trading. By following the AI trading signals you can take the signals and input them into your trading account, allowing for hands-free trading.<br>
AI is much better at predicting price trends. By being able to analyse alternative data and using machine learning, it can generate improved trading signals. Information is able to be obtained from a wide variety of sources such as financial news, social media, news, blogs and transactions.<br>
<br>
<br>
Why not use AI Trading Signals?<br>
They don’t carry out trades on your behalf, they simply inform you of a potential trading opportunity in a given market.<br>
They are not an exact indication to how you should trade. Everyone has different risk tolerances and trading styles, therefore what signal is provided to you may not be best suited for you and your preferences. It’s always your responsibility to make sure you properly analyse before making any trading decisions.<br>
Markets can be unpredictable. At any time, an event whether political or economical  can completely flip the market upside down. If this happens any trading signals  can become irrelevant. Therefore, it’s important to remember that any signal can turn into a bad prediction due to market conditions.<br>
